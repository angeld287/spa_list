## Technologies

- The Ant Design framework is a good option because it better handles components like lists, tables, etc. This framework facilitates the creation of visual interfaces aimed at providing good usability. It also has a very large community.
- Api context is not the best state manager, in my personal experience I have had some problems with data persistence, between different modules. But since this is a project with only one view, only one context is needed.
